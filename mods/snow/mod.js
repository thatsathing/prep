/* This is the template file for modules.
 * 
 * A few key things to note here:
 * 
 * The function 'modSetup()' is run at the very end of setup
 * The function 'modLoop()'  is the last thing run before the text in the draw loop.
 * The active mod MUST be placed in the root directory (of this program.)
 * All mods in the mods/whatever folder are just for storage.
 * Try to use the colors:
 *      secMain
 *      secLight
 *      secDark
 * and  secText,
 *  as that's what all the current and hip modules are using.
 * If you don't want to use a module, put this empty one as active.
 * 
 * Have fun!
 *  ~Ethan
